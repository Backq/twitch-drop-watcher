# Twitch.tv drops auto reclaimer
> This is a program for watch a stream and then reclaim automatically the drop from the stream. I used this for Rust, as you can see into the source. You can filter your "own" games by adding the game's id into the "GameType.class".
> NOTE: Before using the source, you need to get your own client id and bearer token from twitch api, using your own account.
> There are no checks for ip so you can send request without put a proxy list.
